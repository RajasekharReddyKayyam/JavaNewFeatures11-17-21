		 * Java modules, introduced in Java 9 and refined in Java 11,
		 *  help organize and modularize code by dividing large
		 *   applications into smaller, manageable parts. 
		 *   They provide strong encapsulation, ensuring only exposed 
		 *   packages are accessible to other modules. Modules are defined
		 *   
		 *    using a module-info.java file, which declares module 
		 *    dependencies (requires) and exported packages (exports). 
		 *    
		 *    This system enhances maintainability, security, and performance 
		 *    by managing dependencies and minimizing unwanted exposure of internal code.
		 *     The Java module system is especially beneficial
		 *      for large applications and the JDK itself, 
		 * enabling efficient code sharing and modularization.
